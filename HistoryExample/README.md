# History Example

A small console application to show how different types of history affect the execution of nested state machines.  
This application is mainly to see how to build the state machines with JasmSharp, and how the generated code behaves.  

##### To understand the different variants of history, a visualization is available here: [How History States work](https://frantoso.github.io/jasmsharp/).
